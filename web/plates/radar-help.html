	<p>The <strong>Radar</strong> page provides a radar-like view of all aircraft seen within a specified <strong>range</strong> and a specified <strong>altitude difference</strong>. Range and altitude difference can be modified by pressing the buttons left and right of the radar.  
<p>Aircraft where a valid position is received (ADS-B or FLARM if available) are displayed as red aircraft symbols in the direction and distance to the own aircraft. Additionally the altitude difference (in 100 ft) to own altitude with corresponding plus and minus is printed in front of the airplane symbol. If the received traffic report of this aircraft shows "ascending" or "descending", an arrow up or down is added. </p>
<p>If Statux does not receive valid position reports of aircrafts (e.g. only Mode-S without ADSB-OUT) a <strong>green circle</strong> is displayed for this aircraft. The radius of the circle depends on the <strong>signal level</strong> of the received transmission (calculated via an exponential moving average function). Please be aware: The radius of the green circles is a <strong>rough estimation</strong> of the distance of the aircraft!. <strong>Do not expect of displaying a valid distance</strong>, since the signal level depends on many factors (antennas etc.). Nevertheless it may help you to watch out for aircraft nearby.</p>
<p>Along the green circle you will also notice numbers, which show the altitude difference (plus or minus) to your own aircraft, followed by arrow up or down if the aircraft sends vertical speeds</p>
<p>An aircraft is removed from the radar, if it is outside the range, or if there is no transmission received within the last 60 seconds.</p>
<p>The aircraft in the <strong>middle</strong> is a symbol for your own aircraft. Right below the own aircraft the current flight-level is displayed. This level is received from barometric measurement, if your stratux is equipped with it. If not, the flight level is depending on the GPS altitude. Be aware that in this case the altitude difference to other aircraft may be wrong because their position reports are based on barometric measurement. A barometric sensor is therefore absolutely recommended!</p>
<p>A short <strong>beep sound</strong> is played whenever an aircraft is within the inner circle range.</p>
<p><strong>"BpSp/Beep/Spch/SnOff"</strong> toogles between different sound outputs. Default is Beep (5x) and a spoken warning, alternatively only Beep, only Speech or silence. If speech is switched on, a warning e.g. "Traffic at 10 o'clock plus 500 feet" is spoken, whenever an aircraft enters the inner circle.</p>
<p><strong>"F/S"</strong> toggles full screen mode, which displays the radar in maximum screen size (landscape format recommended). </p>
