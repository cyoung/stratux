	<p>The <strong>GPS / AHRS</strong> page provides a view on the current status of GPS data and AHRS orientation. The Satellite count is located on the <strong>Status</strong> page.</p>
	<p>The <strong>GPS</strong> reports position with estimated accuracy, ground track, ground speed, and GPS derived altitude are displayed along with the location depicted on a world map.</p>
	<p>The <strong>AHRS</strong> reports magnetic heading, pressure altitude, pitch and roll are displayed along with a graphical representation of movement.</p>
	<p>The AHR graphical depiction is a 3-dimentional paper airplane which rotates about a heading with 000&deg; being off in the distance and 180&deg; being down in front. The airplane will pitch up/down and left/right based on the data from the AHRS. To aid with recognizing orientation, the <span class="paperairplane_left">left wing is blue</span> and the <span class="paperairplane_right">right wing is tan</span>.</p>
