<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>GPS / AHRS</strong> page provides a view on the current status of GPS data and AHRS orientation. The Satellite count is located on the <strong>Status</strong> page.</p>
	<p><strong>GPS</strong> shows position with estimated accuracy, ground track, ground speed, and geometric altitude. Location is displayed on a world map.</p>
	<p><strong>Satellites</strong> shows the status of GNSS constellations, and lists all satellites that your receiver is tracking. Stratux uses Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) and multi-GNSS solutions on supported receivers. GPS satellites are prefixed with "G", SBAS satellites such as WAAS or EGNOS are prefixed with "S", and Russian GLONASS satellites are prefixed with "R". A checkmark shows if each satellite is used in the current position solution. For each satellite, the elevation, azimuth, and signal strength are provided. A summary of total satellites is presented at the bottom of the table.</p>
	<p><strong>AHRS</strong> reports heading, pressure altitude, pitch and roll, along with a graphical representation of movement. As of version v0.8, heading is derived from GPS track, and is provided in degrees true.</p>
	<p>The AHRS graphical depiction is a 3-dimensional paper airplane. Heading of 000&deg; is depicted with the nose of the airplane into the page; 180&deg; is depicted with the nose pointing out of the page.The airplane will pitch up/down and left/right based on the data from the AHRS. To aid with recognizing orientation, the <span class="paperairplane_left">left wing is blue</span> and the <span class="paperairplane_right">right wing is tan</span>.</p>
