<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>Traffic</strong> page provides a list of all aircraft position reports received within the last 60 seconds. Each time a new aircraft is detected, it is added to the list. Each time a new report is received for an existing aircraft, the list is updated. If a valid position for an aircraft has not been received within the last 60 seconds, the aircraft is removed from the list.</p>
	<p>For each aircraft, the list includes the following details:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Callsign</strong> is the aircraft callsign or tail number. Unknown callsigns will be shown as <span class="label traffic-style11">[--N/A--]</span>. Color and symbol indicates traffic source. <br /><br />Additionally, if <strong>Show Traffic Source In Callsign</strong> is enabled on the <strong>Settings</strong> page, the prefix listed in parenthesis will be added to the beginning of the callsign.<br /><br /></li>

				<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><span class="label" ng-attr-style="background-color: {{esStyleColor}}">&#128745; ADSB1090 (ea)</span> 1090 MHz air-to-air ADS-B traffic is displayed with a medium blue background and airplane symbol.</li>

				<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><span class="">&#128674; AIS (beta)</span> 162Mhz will be shown in various colors based on the vessens category. To see what each category means enable toggle the 'Show Catagory' switch to see them. Due to the way AIS works it is possible that you will see ships positions prior to ships names and tail, this is normal as this information is much less frequent (up to 12 minutes).</li>
		</ul>
		<li><strong>Code</strong> is the ICAO 24-bit code (ADS-B/ADS-R targets), 24-bit FAA-assigned track file ID (TIS-B), or Mode C squawk code, if <strong>Show Squawk</strong> is enabled, and if a squawk code has been received for that target.</li>
		<li><strong>Location</strong> - Reported latitude and longitude, DD° mm'.</li>
		<li><strong>Dist</strong> - Calculated distance to target in nautical miles. Requires GPS position and <strong>Show Distance</strong> slider to be enabled.</li>
		<li><strong>Bearing</strong> - Calculated bearing to target in degrees true. Requires GPS position and <strong>Show Distance</strong> slider to be enabled.</li>
		<li><strong>Altitude</strong> - Reported pressure altitude, feet MSL. Climb or descent rate is also shown if not in level flight.</li>
		<li><strong>Speed</strong> - Reported ground speed, rounded to the nearest 5 knots. Invalid or missing values are shown as '---'.</li>
		<li><strong>Course</strong> - Reported true course, rounded to the nearest 5°. Invalid or missing values are shown as '---'</li>
		<li><strong>Power</strong> - Signal strength in dB. The maximum signal is about +1.4 dB. For typical unamplified SDRs, the minimum detection threshold is about -35 dB for altitude reports, and -30 dB for position reports.</li>
		<li><strong>Age</strong> - Age of the last position report, seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Additionally, if <strong>1090 MHz</strong> is enabled on the <strong>Settings</strong> page, most users will see reports from aircraft in the <strong>Basic Mode S and No-Position Messages</strong> table. These are targets that do not transmitting ADS-B position. Instead, Stratux is picking up altitude, squawk code, and occasionally velocity reports from non-ADS-B Mode S reports. These include air-to-air TCAS messages and radar interrogations, and typically make up the majority of all 1090 messages received.</p>
