<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>Traffic</strong> page provides a list of all aircraft position reports received within the last 60 seconds. Each time a new aircraft is detected, it is added to the list. Each time a new report is received for an existing aircraft, the list is updated. If a valid position for an aircraft has not been received within the last 60 seconds, the aircraft is removed from the list.</p>
	<p>For each aircraft, the list includes the following details:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Callsign</strong> is aircraft tail number or call sign (when available):</li>
		<ul class="list-simple">
				<li><span class="label traffic-style11">&#x2708; 1090 ES</span> ADS-B traffic is displayed with a medium blue background and airplane symbol.</li>
				<li><span class="label traffic-style12">&#x2708; 1090 ES</span> ADS-R traffic is displayed with a light cyan background and airplane symbol.</li>
				<li><span class="label traffic-style14">&#x1f4e1; 1090 ES</span> TIS-B traffic is displayed with a light cyan background and antenna symbol.</li>
				<li><span class="label traffic-style21">&#x2708; 978 UAT</span> ADS-B traffic is displayed with a light tan background and airplane symbol.</li>
				<li><span class="label traffic-style22">&#x2708; 978 UAT</span> ADS-R traffic is displayed with a gold background and airplane symbol.</li>
				<li><span class="label traffic-style24">&#x1f4e1; 978 UAT</span> TIS-B traffic is displayed with a gold background and antenna symbol.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Displayed beneath each callsign is its ICAO 24-bit code (ADS-B/ADS-R targets), 24-bit FAA-assigned track file ID, or its Mode C squawk code, if <strong>Show Squawk</strong> is enabled, and if a squawk code has been received for that target.</li>
		<li><strong>Speed</strong> - Reported ground speed, rounded to the nearest 5 knots. Invalid or missing values are shown as '---'.</li>
		<li><strong>Altitude</strong> - Reported pressure altitude, feet MSL. Climb or descent rate is also shown if not in level flight.</li>
		<li><strong>Course</strong> - Reported true course, rounded to the nearest 5°. Invalid or missing values are shown as '---'</li>
		<li><strong>Location</strong> - Reported latitude and longitude, DD° mm'.</li>
		<li><strong>Dist (NM)</strong> - Calculated distance to target in nautical miles. Requires GPS and <strong>Show Distance</strong> silder to be enabled.</li>
		<li><strong>Bearing</strong> - Calculated bearing to target in degrees true. Requires GPS and <strong>Show Distance</strong> silder to be enabled.</li>
		<li><strong>Power (dB)</strong> - Signal strength in dB. Maximum signal is about +1.4 dB; minimum detection threshold on SDRs is about -35 dB for altitude reports, and -30 dB for position reports.</li>
		<li><strong>Age</strong> - Age of the last position report, seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If <strong>1090 MHz</strong> is enabled on the <strong>Settings</strong> page, most users will see reports from aircraft in the <strong>Basic Mode S Messages and Other No-Position Traffic</strong> table. These are targets that are not transmitting ADS-B position; Stratux is reading their altitude, squawk code, and occasionally velocity from air-to-air TCAS messages and radar interrogations. These types of reports typically make up 80-90% of all 1090 messages received.</p>
