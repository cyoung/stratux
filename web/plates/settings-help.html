<div class="section text-left help-page">
	<p>The <strong>Settings</strong> page provides both control and configuration of your Stratux device.</p>

	<p>Use the toggles in the <strong>Hardware</strong> section to control which hardware devices are active.</p>
	<p class="text-warning">NOTE: Only hardware enabled here will appear on the
		<stron>Status</stron> page.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>978 MHz</strong> and <strong>1090 MHz</strong> enable reception of traffic and weather on those respective frequencies. You must have two receivers installed to receive both frequencies.</li>
		<li><strong>GPS</strong> enables use of a connected GPS on GPIO or USB interfaces. Devices (u-blox or MTK3339 chipset) connected on GPIO UART should be set to 9600 baud for autoconfiguration.</li>
		<li><strong>AHRS</strong> enables a MPU6050 6-axis gyro and BMP180 pressure sensor connected to the GPIO I2C pins. Use in navigation EFB software additionally requires an AHRS Output option to be selected as described below.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The <strong>Diagnostics</strong> section helps with debugging and communicating with the Stratux project contributors via GitHub, Slack, and the reddit subgroup.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Traffic Markings</strong> prepends two letters in front of the callsign of traffic targets within your navigation application. The first letter will be <code>u</code> for traffic received on 978/UAT, and <code>e</code> for 1090-ES. The second letter indicates the type of target: <code>a</code> for ADS-B air-to-air, <code>r</code> for ADS-R ground-to-air rebroadcast, and <code>t</code> for TIS-B ground-to-air broadcast.</li>
			<li><strong>Verbose Logs</strong> logs additional messages to <code>stratux.log</code> to aid in development and troubleshooting. This file is accessible from the <strong>Logs</strong> menu available on the left.</li>
			<li><strong>Record Logs</strong> enables logging to a series of files for your Stratux device including raw data recorded for UAT traffic and weather, 1090 traffic, GPS messages, and AHRS messages. The log files are accessible from the <strong>Logs</strong> menu available on the left.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>The <strong>Configuration</strong> section lets you adjust the default operation of your Stratux device.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enabling <strong>AHRS Output to EFB</strong> will send AHRS data from a hardware AHRS (enabled in "Hardware") or GPS Simulated AHRS (enabled in "Experimental Configuration Options") to attached compatible clients over the WiFi interface using the GDL90 protocol. <strong class="text-warning">This option must be disabled for compatibility with ForeFlight 7.6.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>To avoid having your own aircraft appear as traffic and scare the bejeezus out of you, you may provide your <strong>Mode S code</strong>. This will also give you the option of detecting your airplane's pressure altitude, if it is Mode S or ADS-B equipped. You can find this value in the FAA N-Number Registry for your aircraft. You should use the hexadecimal value (not the octal value) for this setting. No validation is done so please ensure you enter your valide Mode S value.
		</li>
		<li>The <strong>Weather</strong> page uses a user-defined <strong>Watch List</strong> to filter the large volume of ADS-B weather messages for display. Define a list of identifiers (airport, VOR, etc) separated by a spaces. For example <code>KBOS EEN LAH LKP</code>. You may change this list at any time and the <strong>Weather</strong> page will start watching for the updated list immediately.
			<br/>
			<span class="text-warning">NOTE: To save your changes, you must either tap somehwere else on the page or hit <code>ENTER</code> or <code>RETURN</code> or <code>GO</code> (or whatever your keyboard indicates).</span>
		</li>
		<li>The SDR (software defined radio) receiver support an adjustment in the form of a <strong>PPM Correction</strong>. From the Raspberry Pi, you may use the command <code>kal -g 48 -s GSM850</code> to scan for available channels in your area. Then use the command <code>kal -g 48 -c <em>channel#</em></code> to calculate the PPM.
			<br/>
			<span class="text-warning">NOTE: You will need to perform all commands as <code>root</code> by issuing the command: <code>sudo su -</code>. You will need to stop the Stratux software before running the calibration process. You can stop all of the Stratux processes with the command: <code>pkill screen</code>.</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
   <p>The <strong>Commands</strong> section lets you upgrade the system software, or safely shutdown / reboot your Stratux device.</p> 
   <ul>
   <li>Stratux software updates can be loaded if you <strong>Click to select System Update file</strong> and follow the prompts. Upgrade packages will be available on stratux.me or GitHub.</li>
   <li><strong>Shutdown</strong> will immediately shutdown the Stratux.  You may then safely remove power.</li>
   <li><strong>Reboot</strong> will immediately reboot the Stratux.  After the reboot you may have to rejoin the WiFi connection to reconnect.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The <strong>Experimental Configuration Options</strong> section contains new alpha / beta features that enhance Stratux but need validation before they are considered production ready.</p> 
   <ul>
   <li><strong>ForeFlight 'Flight Simulator' AHRS Output</strong> uses a ForeFlight's flight simulator interface to send position, traffic, and AHRS data. It is intended to be a developer tool for evaluating AHRS functions, and may not work correctly in the air. It is also incompatible with the normal Stratux operating mode, and will cause FIS-B weather to be disabled on ForeFlight, and all Stratux output to be disabled for other apps.</li>
   <li><strong>Traffic Demo</strong> circulates a 40-mile diameter flock of simulated traffic around your position. This can be used to validate that your navigation / EFB software is connecting and displaying traffic.</li>
   <li><strong>FLARM-Formatted Serial Traffic Output</strong> sends traffic formatted with the FLARM glider computer protocol out over a USB serial connection (/dev/ttyUSB0, 38400 bps). It will disable any USB serial devices that appear as /dev/ttyUSB0 (e.g. BU-353), but not those that appear as ttyACM0 (e.g VK-172)</li>
   <li><strong>GPS Simulated AHRS</strong> tracks GPS groundspeed, vertical speed, and heading, and uses a dynamic model to calculate the pitch and roll a coordinated airplane would experience. Think of it as an intelligent partial-panel. GPS must be enabled and AHRS disabled in the <strong>Hardware</strong> section for this to function.</li>
   <li><strong>Use ADS-B Ownship Altitude and Callsign</strong> will attempt to detect your aircraft's Mode S or ADS-B output if its Mode S code is entered in the <strong>Configuration</strong> section. If detected, it will use the callsign and pressure altitude when sending ownship messages to your navigation software.</li>
   </ul>
